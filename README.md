#### Helper projects:
- [Written with this example](https://codepen.io/jh3y/pen/rpoxxL)

#### Small Instruction
Initialization of this extension starts with `entry/loader.js`. It loads resources that are written in `manifest.json` and appends them into html.
Resources of `CSS` are located in `public/` directory, resources of `js` are located in `dist/` directory which is output directory for compiled typescript code (typescript files are `src/` folder).
